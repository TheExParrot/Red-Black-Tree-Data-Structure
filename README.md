# Red-Black Tree Data Structure with void pointer keys
A C program that is able to store data in a red-black tree data structure.
The fully modular design of this program means that it can be used with a plethora of data types, only requiring a comparison function and a print function for full operation.
Simply use the 'rbtree.h' and 'rbtree.c' files and look at the main file for how to utilise this data structure.

Operations include:
- Inserting nodes
- Searching for keys
- Deleting specific keys
- Printing the entire tree in-order traversal
- Post-order traversal for memory safe programming
